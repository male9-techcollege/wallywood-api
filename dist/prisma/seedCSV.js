The console logs below are taken from this source.

In the example in Node.js Crash Course by Traversy Media on YouTube, the code is:
url.fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)
the first url representing the built-in url module, but unlike that author, we are just importing fileURLToPath from url package, not the whole package.
As a consequence, it is not necessary to indicate the JS module and then the desired function in that module.

This finds the __filename and __dirname of the current ES module: */
const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
console.log("ES Module file path:", __filename);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);
console.log("ES Module directory:", __dirname);
/* My additions based on example in Node.js Crash Course by Traversy Media on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32M1al-Y6Ag :
.basename() returns the last portion of a path;
.parse() returns all the different parts of a path */
const __basenameByMariePierreLessard = path.basename(__filename);
console.log("Just the file name with the extension:", __basenameByMariePierreLessard);
const __parsedPathByMariePierreLessard = path.parse(__filename);
console.log("All the parts of the file path:", __parsedPathByMariePierreLessard);
/* Acc. to  Node.js Crash Course by Traversy Media on YouTube, the following line makes sure that
the right delimiters are used in the file path (forward or backward slash depending on the OS).
In this case, a folder called csv is joined together with (getting appended to) __dirname.

"Use path.join() or path.resolve() with __dirname to build file paths in CommonJS modules.
For ES modules, use import.meta.url with fileURLToPath and dirname to get the equivalent functionality."
https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_path.asp
And yet, the following constant in the Moodle instructions.
const dir = path.join(__dirname, "csv");

Same advice is found on Stackoverflow: Ivan Gabriele advises to use path.join() in ES-module.
Another option: see example provided by Bernat on same page, ie.:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46745014/alternative-for-dirname-in-node-js-when-using-es6-modules

Acc. to advice by jameshfisher found at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16301503/can-i-use-requirepath-join-to-safely-concatenate-urls ,
citing the URL living standard at https://url.spec.whatwg.org,
something like the following should work, but it doesn't (type error: invalid URL). My test database was not seeded even though no error was thrown in the terminal.
const dir = new URL('/csv', __dirname).href;
I got the same type error with:
const dir = new URL('csv', __dirname).href;
I asked Heinz why, but he doesn't know this syntax, and he doesn't think that the recommendation on W3 Schools matters much because the method below works.

    As a consequence, this code does not allow the importation of CSV files in a specific reading order based on relationships.
    This means that I cannot seed certain tables because their records can only exist if other records in other tables exist.
    The solution is to limit seeding to the tables on which future records in other tables will depend. */

        The nullish coalescing operator provides a default value for null or undefined values. (...) It is a newer addition to JavaScript (introduced in the ES2020 specification) that explicitly checks for null or undefined values rather than any falsy value. (...)
        In this code, the logical OR operator provides default values for userName and userAge if the corresponding input variables are falsy. However, what if you wanted to allow the user to enter a name or age of 0? In that case, the logical OR operator would not work as expected because 0 is a falsy value.
        In summary, the nullish coalescing operator is a valuable addition to JavaScript that allows you to provide default values for variables more precisely and reasonably. It’s handy when you need to allow for the possibility of null or undefined values or when you want to avoid assigning default values for other falsy values such as 0 or “”."
