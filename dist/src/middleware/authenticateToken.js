/* "Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the application’s request-response cycle. The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.
Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
- Execute any code.
- Make changes to the request and the response objects.
- End the request-response cycle.
- Call the next middleware in the stack.
If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging. (...)
The next() function is not a part of the Node.js or Express API, but is the third argument that is passed to the middleware function. The next() function could be named anything, but by convention it is always named “next”. To avoid confusion, always use this convention."
https://expressjs.com/en/guide/writing-middleware.html
So, the function that calls (provides arguments to) function expression authenticateToken has to indicate what the following (next) function is.
Acc. to instructions on Moodle, it is the router that calls both the middleware authenticateToken and the controller getUserProfile by separating them by a comma.
That is not the usual way of providing an argument, but that is the next function.
