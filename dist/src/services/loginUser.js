Code to access the database should be in service layer instead of keeping in Controller or Model. (...)
ASP.NET MVC and MVC, in general, is a presentation layer pattern; thus your interaction with the database should be in a layer beyond the presentation layer, usually a data-access layer, but it could be a service layer or business layer as well."

    "Examples of Syntactic Sugar in JavaScript
    Written by Sophia on August 08, 2020. (...)
    In this blog, we'll go over a few of examples of syntactic sugar in JavaScript:
    - for...of loop
    - Destructuring (...)
    With destructuring, we can also assign new variable names with a value other than the object's key.
    In this example, we create a new variable, superheroName, and assign it the value 'quake', from agents' nickname property.
        // Create new variable superheroName, with the value agent.nickname ('quake')
        let { nickname: superheroName } = agent
        console.log(superheroName) // 'quake' (...)
    In this example, we achieve the same functionality as above using destructuring. We create new variables from the values of the agents array in one line.
        // Create agents array
        let agents = ['coulson', 'may', 'daisy', 'simmons', 'fitz']
        // Use destructuring to create new variables from the agents array
        let [coulson, may, daisy, simmons, fitz] = agents (...)"

    /* Research on the use of ... (aka. suspension points, ellipsis or three dots) in JS:
    "The spread operator (…) and the rest parameter (…) in JavaScript are both denoted by three dots (…), but they serve different purposes. (...)
    The rest operator(…) is used in function parameters to collect all remaining arguments into an array. (...)
    The spread operator is used for expanding elements, while the rest parameter is used for collecting multiple elements into an array."
